As you can see, unfortunately i did not complete the test.  My inexperience with
cypress counted against me when i came across areas i hadn't used cypress to test before,
especially logging in directly rather than through the UI (which i really wanted to get
working as i knew it would speed the tests up), and the datepicker threw me as well.

If I had had more time I would have:
1) obviously covered the language generation page
2) kept one end to end test that filled in all form inputs on each page using
  dynamic data from form-values.json, but then separated out the individual
  form inputs into their own test cases for more asserts and boundary
  checking to keep the tests granularity

This was a great learning exercise for me, and even though i didn't ace this,
I would like to say that if you still considered me for the role, I would spend
whatever time I had before I started, filling in the holes in my cypress knowledge, so I
could hit the ground running when I started.
